                    WITH ANYONE?&quot; above), in and other countries. If you are a resident in the
                    European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data
                    protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country.
                    We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information
                    in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law. 7. HOW LONG DO WE
                    KEEP YOUR INFORMATION? In Short: We keep your information for as long as

                    otherwise required by law. We will only keep your personal information for as
                    long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless
                    a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
                    accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require

                    users have an account with us. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need
                    to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
                    information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
                    information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store
                    your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until
                    deletion is possible. 8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE? In Short: We aim
                    to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and

                    organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
                    personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
                    secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
                    information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
                    promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
                    parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access,
                    steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your
                    personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our
                    Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure
                    environment. 9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS? In Short: You may review, change,

                    browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
                    Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal
                    your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
                    monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
                    recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
                    currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
                    automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
                    for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
                    you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. 11. DO
